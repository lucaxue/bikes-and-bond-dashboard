# Levelupathon!

## Today, your challenge is to create a full-stack application of your choice... the sky is the limit! There are some stipulations for aspects that must be included in your project. These are:

### Required:

- Disney ideation
- Auth0
- React context
- C# back end
- At least one test

### Bonus:

- In a Docker container
- Auth0 on back end as well
- More tests!
- User stories
- React Router
- tailwindcss

We will see your lovely creations at the end of the day. Happy hacking! :)

DISNEY IDEATION

- Plant app - enter the plant type, log in, have a schedule of when to water/how to love and care for

REALIST

- Merging of Bond & Bikes log into the spy dashboard where you fetch a suitable bike for the mission
  - BACKEND

    - Mission location (text) -
    - Mission task (text) -
    - Mission Difficulty (int) -
  - REST API CRUD

Backend Dev 
- Controllers ✅
- Models ✅
- create Postgress DB - heroku ✅
- create SQL db and insert 
- link to User Secrets ✅
- build Repos ✅
- test Postman ✅
- Get PUT and POST working for CRUD ✅
- Search functionality ✅
- CORS ✅
- Insert Function 


FRONTEND
  - Login with AUTH0
  - ~~James Goosebond gmail~~ 
  jamesgoosebond007@gmail.com P: J4m3sG00s3B0nd007
  - React router
    - Dashboard/homepage/log in/weather api
    - Mission page
    - bike page
    - profile page with logout
  - CSS modules + React context
  - Separate Theme Context File, 
  - context: css object of the theme + toggletheme
  - Jest test

NEXT STEPS - break down frontend pages with component tree 15 mins

CRITIC

- If we can only make one table make the mission table
- Just do one jest test
- If we can't do React router use one dashboard page with logout/log in
- Drop the weather API
